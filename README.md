# Lifelink

This project aims to be an android application that covers the weak spots of state-of-the-art MTG life counter apps.

A life counter for Magic: the Gathering is a tool players use to keep track of their life totals. Most often, 2-4 players all huddle around a single screen with 2-4 buttons per player (+1, -1, +5 etc.). This clutters the screen with multiple buttons that do the same thing albeit to different players life totals. Lifelink solves this by having each participant use their own phone and then *connecting locally* so that every player can see everyone's life total, but only have the buttons they are supposed to use.
